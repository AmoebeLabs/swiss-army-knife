#Introducing 10 step (or less) tutorials

Everybody has learned to count from 1 to 10 when we were young. 10 steps are also manageable to learning something. Not all tutorials will contain the full 10 steps if we simply don't need more steps to finish the tutorial.

I just started creating these tutorials, so I am still finding out what works and what doesn't work.
