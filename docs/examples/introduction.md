I have put several examples into there own SAK Example view for easy reference.
The eight examples show in most cases more than one card, or more than one visualization.

Some of them use SAK templates, some of them Decluttering templates, some both, and some none: they contain the full configuration in the view itself.

!!! Info "All examples use the `NM - Gonsboro` theme. This one is included on Github."
    Apart from the box-shadow for the cards, this theme also defines some color schemes used by the cards.
    
    Other themes might show black colors where theme colors are used.
    
##:sak-sak-logo: Platforms tested
I have tested SAK - and thus the examples - on the following platforms:

- Safari (mobile and desktop view) on iOS/iPadOS 14 & 15, iPhone & iPad
- Google Chrome > 90.x on Windows 10, on my 10 year old Desktop :smile: 

By testing Chrome, I assume I validated all the Chromium based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Opera, Vivaldi, Brave, Blisk, etc). That should also cover Android devices using Chromium based browsers which I could not test as I don't have any Android devices.
A quick view on a friends Samsung showed no problems, but that is no 100% guarantee of course.

Due to the browser differences and long standing bugs in Safari, some parts of SAK have different rendering paths for Safari and Chromium.

One notable difference between the two is the SVG filter implementation of Safari. It works, but takes a small performance hit compared to Chromium, which has a better and faster filter implementation. Safari users will therefore see a difference between a _switch_ to a view with filters (like a Neumorphic design) and Flat design: the latter is faster with the initial loading of the view.
