##:sak-sak-logo: Card configuration

Using a specific Home Assistant theme for your Swiss Army Knife custom card is nothing more than specifying the name of the theme that is in the list of Home Assistant themes:

```yaml linenums="1" hl_lines="4"
  - type: 'custom:swiss-army-knife-card'
    entities:
      <list of entities>
    theme: M3-D04-Magenta
```
!!! Info "You can only select themes that are known to Home Assistant"

!!! Warning "Loading a specific theme per card does cost resources"
    Every theme needs RAM memory. If you only need a few colors, consider using a color swatch!

##:sak-sak-logo: Example views
The examples show the Magenta Material 3 theme applied to a single card between the other cards which use the Teal Blue Material 3 theme that is loaded by Home Assistant.
