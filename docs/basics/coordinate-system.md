The Swiss Army Knife map uses a simplified coordinate system to simplify the design and placement of toolsets and tools on a card.

##:sak-sak-logo: Basics
The coordinate system of a SAK Card is based on the following characteristics:

**Card:**

- A SAK Card has a configurable `aspectratio`
- That aspect ratio determines the internal grid size: `aspect ratio * 100`.

**Toolset & Tools:**

- A Toolset has a default 100x100 grid size. It does NOT depend on the size of a card.
- The top-left is the origin (0,0)
- The center coordinates of a toolset are (50,50)
- All tool dimensions are relative to the default toolset grid size: a line with a length of 10 means 10% of the grid.

The next paragraph shows an example, and the paragraphs thereafter more details.

##:sak-sak-logo: An example: Toolset and tool placement @ work
Now we know the basics, let's look at the example with a card size of 200x100 (2/1 aspect ratio) and two identical toolsets consisting of a `circle`, `icon`, and `state`. 

The tools are neatly configured around the center position (50,50) of the toolset grid:

- the `circle` is placed at (50,50) with its radius of 25,
- the `icon` is placed at (50,40) and
- the `state` is placed at (50,60).

The first toolset is placed at (40,50) on the card, and the second toolset at (160,50) on the card. 

In a kind of 3D world, it looks like this:
![sak-card-toolset-tool-placement]

The YAML configuration is shown below. Here you see the toolsets (named set1 and set2) and the different tools: `circle`, `state` and `icon`. For brevity only the coordinates/sizes part is shown.

```yaml linenums="1" hl_lines="6 11 17 22 29 34 40 45"
aspectratio: 2/1              # Gives a 200x100 canvas size

layout:
  # Circles with icon and state are placed at (40,50) and (160,50)
  toolsets:
    - toolset: set1
      position:
        cx: 40
        cy: 50
      tools:
        - type: circle
          position:
            cx: 50            # Circle is centered on 100x100
            cy: 50
            radius: 25

        - type: state
          position:
            cx: 50            # x centered
            cy: 60            # y a bit lower

        - type: icon
          position:
            cx: 50            # x centered
            cy: 40            # y a bit higher
            align: center
            icon_size: 15

    - toolset: set2
      position:
        cx: 160
        cy: 50
      tools:
        - type: circle
          position:
            cx: 50            # Circle is centered on 100x100
            cy: 50
            radius: 25

        - type: state
          position:
            cx: 50            # x centered
            cy: 60            # y a bit lower

        - type: icon
          position:
            cx: 50            # x centered
            cy: 40            # y a bit higher
            align: center
            icon_size: 15

```

##:sak-sak-logo: More indepth: Card aspect ratio and size
Below you see the configuration of a 1/1 square card which equals a grid size of 100x100.
```yaml
- type: 'custom:swiss-army-knife-card'
  aspectratio: 1/1        # Square 1/1 card with resulting 100x100 grid size
```
###Example cards with different aspect ratio's
Some examples for aspect ratio's and (grid size) of: `0.5/1` (50x100), `1/1` (100x100), `2/1` (200x100) and `3/1` (300x100):

<svg viewBox="0 0 680 100" style="fill:var(--md-primary-fg-color--light);margin:10px;padding:10px;">
  <rect x="0" y="0" width="50" height="100" rx="5"/>
  <rect x="60" y="0" width="100" height="100" rx="5"/>
  <rect x="170" y="0" width="200" height="100" rx="5"/>
  <rect x="380" y="0" width="300" height="100" rx="5"/>
</svg>

!!! Info "You are not limited to these aspect ratio's. Any aspect ratio will work"

###But what about the internal grid size then?
If I would place three square cards in a `horizontal-stack` with different aspect ratio's, I get three equally sized cards. All cards scale to the same actual size in pixels, independently of their internal grid sizes of 100x100, 200x200 and 400x400.

<svg viewBox="0 0 310 100" style="fill:var(--md-primary-fg-color--light);margin:10px;padding:10px;">
  <rect x="0" y="0" width="100" height="100" rx="5"/>
  <text x="50" y="55" font-size="12" text-anchor="middle" fill="var(--md-primary-bg-color)">1/1</text>
  <rect x="105" y="0" width="100" height="100" rx="5"/>
  <text x="155" y="55" font-size="12" text-anchor="middle" fill="var(--md-primary-bg-color)">2/2</text>
  <rect x="210" y="0" width="100" height="100" rx="5"/>
  <text x="260" y="55" font-size="12" text-anchor="middle" fill="var(--md-primary-bg-color)">4/4</text>
</svg>

The result of these different internal sizes can be seen in the following example: I "designed" a toolset with a single circle on a standard 100x100 canvas and placed the toolset for each card on the same position (50,50); The circle scales to the actual grid size of the card. **Scalable** Vector Graphics at work!
<svg viewBox="0 0 310 100" style="fill:var(--md-primary-fg-color--light);margin:10px;padding:10px;">
  <rect x="0" y="0" width="100" height="100" rx="5"/>
  <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="50" fill="lightgrey"/>
  <text x="50" y="55" font-size="12" text-anchor="middle" fill="var(--md-primary-bg-color)">1/1</text>
  <rect x="105" y="0" width="100" height="100" rx="5"/>
  <circle cx="130" cy="25" r="25" fill="lightgrey"/>
  <text x="155" y="55" font-size="12" text-anchor="middle" fill="var(--md-primary-bg-color)">2/2</text>
  <rect x="210" y="0" width="100" height="100" rx="5"/>
  <circle cx="222.5" cy="12.5" r="12.5" fill="lightgrey"/>
  <text x="260" y="55" font-size="12" text-anchor="middle" fill="var(--md-primary-bg-color)">4/4</text>
</svg>

!!! Info "The `1/1`, `2/1` and `3/1` are mostly used for mobile phones, and the much larger ones, say 4/4 for panels"
    The tools on a 4/4 would be too small to read on a mobile phone, but are excellent on large displays.

##:sak-sak-logo: More indepth: Toolset aspect ratio and size
As already mentioned, the position and dimensions of a tool *always* reference a *default* toolset grid size of 100x100:

- (0,0) is the upper left corner of the grid
- (100,100) is the lower right corner of the grid
- (50,50) is the center of the grid and servers as the 'anchor' used by the Toolset to position the tools on a card.
    
Furthermore, all dimensions are *relative* to the grid:
   
- a line with a length of 10 takes 10% of the grid.
- a circle with radius of 50 fits exactly the grid.

!!! Warning "The size and position of tools are not limited by this grid size!"
    So:
    
    - a tool can be wider and higher
    - a tool can be placed outside these default coordinates: so coordinates can be < 0 or > 100.
    
    This means that - without scaling - such a toolset does NOT fit a `1/1` card!  
    Such toolsets are therefore designed for larger cards.

!!! Note "Don't forget that toolsets can scale tools and are re-usable if defined as a template" 

##:sak-sak-logo: Use relative sizes for styles too, where possible
The dimensions of the tool are relative. Therefore, it is recommended to also use relative dimensions for styling. A simple example is the CSS `font-size` attribute: use `em` and not `px` to configure the size of a font, ie use `font-size: 12em`. 

SAK has set the default `font-size` for SAK cards to be about the same size as 1% of the grid: so `font-size: 10em` should equal 10% of the grid.
