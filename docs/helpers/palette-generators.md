##:sak-sak-logo: Accessible Palette Color System Generator
With the Accessible palette website, you can create Material Design color systems with consistent lightness and contrast. Nice for your custom colors to create matching pairs!

You can use a single color with varying lightness for displaying steps in the segmented arc for instance.

Also a great tool if you are using the [Material 3 themes for Home Assistant!](https://ha-m3-themes.docs.amoebelabs.com)

##:sak-sak-logo: Color Designer to Create Tints and Shades
Color Designer is great for creating tints and shades, among a few other color combinations.

These tints and shades use the HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) representation of the RGB color model. These are not fully accurate compared to the human perception of lightness. Use the previous one, the accessible palette generator for a better match!
