Due to a lot of work to handle my sister's estate, I was unable to do any work on this card, but it will still be released, yet with a bit more unresolved issues!

- Currently in **closed** BETA with around 40 users.
- Next step will be a **public** BETA, announced here and on the Home Assistant community forum.
- Depending on the issues, more BETA's (v0.9.x) will be released.
- And if that goes well, version 1.0.0 will be released ðŸš€.
