# ![](docs/assets/images/swiss-army-knife24.png) Swiss Army Knife custom card manual

This is the home of the [Swiss Army Knife custom card for Home Assistant documentation](https://swiss-army-knife-card-manual.amoebelabs.com/).

The custom Swiss Army Knife card for [Home Assistant][home-assistant] allows you to create your own visualization using [17 basic, advanced and Home Assistant specific SVG-based tools][sak-tools] and CSS [styling][sak-css-styles] and [animation][sak-css-animations] options this card provides.

It is a card with lots of possibilities, fully YAML based, and requires the [user to design a card][sak-how-to-design-your-card]!
What you can make is only limited by the 17 provided tools and your own imagination.

## ![](docs/assets/images/swiss-army-knife24.png) __Development status as of June 2022:__

Due to a lot of work to handle my sister's estate, I was unable to do any work on this card the past couple of months. This month work has resumed to release the card as a Release Candidate!

- Currently in **closed** BETA with around 40 users.
- Next step will be a **public** Release Candidate (v1.0.0-rc.1), announced here and on the Home Assistant community forum.
- Depending on the issues, more RC's ((v1.0.0-rc.x) will be released.
- And if that goes well, I will release version 1.x.y after about a month ðŸš€.
