# ![](docs/assets/images/swiss-army-knife24.png) Swiss Army Knife custom card manual

This is the home of the [Swiss Army Knife custom card for Home Assistant documentation](https://swiss-army-knife-card-manual.amoebelabs.com/).

The custom Swiss Army Knife card for [Home Assistant][home-assistant] allows you to create your own visualization using [17 basic, advanced and Home Assistant specific SVG-based tools][sak-tools] and CSS [styling][sak-css-styles] and [animation][sak-css-animations] options this card provides.

It is a card with lots of possibilities, fully YAML based, and requires the [user to design a card][sak-how-to-design-your-card]!
What you can make is only limited by the 17 provided tools and your own imagination.

## ![](docs/assets/images/swiss-army-knife24.png) __Development status as of May 2023:__

The card has been released on June 19th, 2022 to the public as a release candidate!

After a few more RC's, I decided that it was time to pick up a normal version numbering in 2023.
