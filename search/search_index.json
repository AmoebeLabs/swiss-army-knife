The first lights row shows some cards with different experimental sliders and a segmented arc to display the brightness. The other rows show a standard light card. The light switch (all cards) The light switch is made out of 3 circles and an icon: the 1 st (bottom) circle is used to get the Neumorphic effect: a button that 'rises' out of the background. It also servers as the edge of the light button. the second circle is used to display the activation ring; orange if 'on' and light grey if 'off'. the third (top) circle is used to display the inset shadow effect as if the button is \"pressed\". last but not least: the light icon is displayed on top of all those circles. First card The first card shows a \"more-info\" button in the top left, the ligh button, the name of the light, and a slider with the actual percentage on the right side of the slider. The position of that value can be defined in the card. Second and third card The configurable position of the percentage is visible in the second and third card: apart from using a different styled slider, the percentage is shown in the circle where the segmented arc is also defined.

Therefore it is difficult to activate the menu as SVG Icons can only be touched/clicked on the foreground part of the icon. The slider has a touch/click area attached, so is perfectly to use Except for a little bug where the thumb is pulled to the edge of the touch/click area or the brightness is set to 100%, and cannot be controlled anymore. In this case clicking/touching the slider makes the thumb accessible again.

That's good! If you're a graphic designer or at least some UX guy/woman, you will probably have tons of idea's, and after understanding the possibilities, you immediately fired up Adobe Indesign, Affinity Designer, Inkscape or Procreate on your PC/Mac/iPad or went online on Figma or some other online tool to sketch your design. You're one of those people: The nice thing about the Swiss Army Knife is that you can design your own card. But not everybody is a graphical designer, so how to approach designing a visualization in that case if you'r one of the below people? The bad thing about the Swiss Army Knife is that you do need a design for a card. Get inspired! \u00b6 If you browse the internet you can find all sorts of visualizations. I just picked 3 as an example: The left one is a very simple and flat design without any fancy things on it. The middle is a based on a Neumorphic design. A Design that I used for most of my examples. You'll probably recognize the typical discs! The right one resembles a homekit design. It is clean and simple. All three are completely different designs, and all three can be build using the Swiss Army Knife card! Of course, you can't build them EXACTLY that way, but you can come along way mimicing these examples. You will find several designs in the examples Most of them are (currently) using a Neumorphic design, but other flat and Homekit alike designs are also there. Ok, I got inspired. Now what? \u00b6 Well, you can try different approaches. I use two - The well known \"I sketch something\" and then try to create this using trial-and-error - I make a design on a 100x100 artboard, and then make the card using the design's measurements and coordinates Sketching with trial-and-error \u00b6 Making a real design \u00b6 Below you see Affinity Designer in action. For example #6, I wanted to create something different with circles as the background, and on top of that some SAK tools (circles) with weather and airvisual data. For this I created an artboard with size 100mmx100mm. This is the default 'coordinate' system for a square card. This means that the coordinates shown by Affinity Designer can be copied 1:1 in the cards YAML definition. No trial-and-error this time placing the tools on the right location. The units used are NOT relevant, it's all about a 100x100 canvas. Use centons if you like... As an example I selected one of the circles where the weather type will be put. In the lower rigth corner, you can see that I selected the center coordinates and (if you look closely) that the X coordinate is 77 (mm) and the Y coordinate 59 (mm). You also notice the width/height for the circle is 22 (mm). The resulting partial YAML definition is as follows: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 - toolset : weather-type position : # The center X and Y position from Affinity Designer cx : 77 cy : 59 tools : # The height is 22.
