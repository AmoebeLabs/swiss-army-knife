Basics \u00b6 The coordinate system of a SAK Card is based on the following characteristics: Card: A SAK Card has a configurable aspectratio That aspect ratio determines the internal grid size: aspect ratio * 100 . Toolset & Tools: A Toolset has a default 100x100 grid size. It does NOT depend on the size of a card. The top-left is the origin (0,0) The center coordinates of a toolset are (50,50) All tool dimensions are relative to the default toolset grid size: a line with a length of 10 means 10% of this default grid. The next paragraph shows an example, and the paragraphs thereafter more details. An example: Toolset and tool placement @ work \u00b6 Now we know the basics, let's look at the example with a card size of 200x100 (2/1 aspect ratio) and two identical toolsets consisting of a circle , icon , and state . The tools are neatly configured around the center position (50,50) of the toolset grid: the circle is placed at (50,50) with its radius of 25, the icon is placed at (50,40) and the state is placed at (50,60). The first toolset is placed at (40,50) on the card, and the second toolset at (160,50) on the card. In a kind of 3D world, it looks like this: The YAML configuration is shown below. Here you see the toolsets (named set1 and set2) and the different tools: circle , state and icon . For brevity only the coordinates/sizes part is shown. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 aspectratio : 2/1 # Gives a 200x100 canvas size layout : # Circles with icon and state are placed at (40,50) and (160,50) toolsets : - toolset : set1 position : cx : 40 cy : 50 tools : - type : circle position : cx : 50 # Circle is centered on 100x100 cy : 50 radius : 25 - type : state position : cx : 50 # x centered cy : 60 # y a bit lower - type : icon position : cx : 50 # x centered cy : 40 # y a bit higher align : center icon_size : 15 - toolset : set2 position : cx : 160 cy : 50 tools : - type : circle position : cx : 50 # Circle is centered on 100x100 cy : 50 radius : 25 - type : state position : cx : 50 # x centered cy : 60 # y a bit lower - type : icon position : cx : 50 # x centered cy : 40 # y a bit higher align : center icon_size : 15 More indepth: Card aspect ratio and size \u00b6 Below you see the configuration of a 1/1 square card which equals a grid size of 100x100. - type : 'custom:swiss-army-knife-card' aspectratio : 1/1 # Square 1/1 card with resulting 100x100 grid size Example cards with different aspect ratio's \u00b6 Some examples for aspect ratio's and (grid size) of: 0.5/1 (50x100), 1/1 (100x100), 2/1 (200x100) and 3/1 (300x100): You are not limited to these aspect ratio's. Any aspect ratio will work But what about the internal grid size then? \u00b6 If I would place three square cards in a horizontal-stack with different aspect ratio's, I get three equally sized cards. All cards scale to the same actual size in pixels, independently of their internal grid sizes of 100x100, 200x200 and 400x400. 1/1 2/2 4/4 The result of these different internal sizes can be seen in the following example: I \"designed\" a toolset with a single circle on a standard 100x100 canvas and placed the toolset for each card on the same position (50,50); The circle scales to the actual grid size of the card. Scalable Vector Graphics at work! 1/1 2/2 4/4 The 1/1, 2/1 and 3/1 are mostly used for mobile phones, and the much larger ones, say 4/4 for panels The tools on a 4/4 would be too small to read on a mobile phone, but are excellent on large displays. More indepth: Toolset aspect ratio and size \u00b6 As already mentioned, the position and dimensions of a tool always reference a default toolset grid size of 100x100: (0,0) is the upper left corner of the grid (100,100) is the lower right corner of the grid (50,50) is the center of the grid and servers as the 'anchor' used by the Toolset to position the tools on a card. Furthermore, all dimensions are relative to the grid: a line with a length of 10 takes 10% of the grid. a circle with radius of 50 fits exactly the grid. The size and position of tools are not limited by this grid size! So: a tool can be wider and higher a tool can be placed outside these default coordinates: so coordinates can be < 0 or > 100. This means that - without scaling - such a toolset does NOT fit a 1/1 card! Such toolsets are therefore designed for larger cards. Don't forget that toolsets can scale tools and are re-usable if defined as a template Use relative sizes for styles too, where possible \u00b6 The dimensions of the tool are relative. Therefore, it is recommended to also use relative dimensions for styling. A simple example is the CSS font-size attribute: use em and not px to configure the size of a font, ie use font-size: 12em . SAK has set the default font-size for SAK cards to be about the same size as 1% of the grid: so font-size: 10em should equal 10% of the grid.","title":"Coordinate system"},{"location":"basics/coordinate-system/#basics","text":"The coordinate system of a SAK Card is based on the following characteristics: Card: A SAK Card has a configurable aspectratio That aspect ratio determines the internal grid size: aspect ratio * 100 .

These interactions are NOT card-based but tool-based: in other words, every Swiss Army Knife Tool can function as a \"Button\" to perform actions. Interacting with SVG objects \u00b6 There are some things to keep in mind when interacting with SVG objects because their interaction is different from HTML objects. HTML does create a so-called bounding box around the objects to facilitate interaction (mouse or touch) with them. SVG doesn't have that functionality yet: it's part of the unreleased SVG 2.0 specification. Interaction with an SVG object depends on things like an object's 'fill', its 'visibility', and whether it has been painted or not. For an interactive, visual explanation: see Managing SVG Interaction With The Pointer Events Property What does this mean for Swiss Army Knife Tools? \u00b6 Generally speaking: there are no problems with Swiss Army Knife tools: you won't notice the difference between SVG and HTML-based objects. This applies at least to text-based tools like entity names, areas, and states. For the graphical tools like circles and rectangles for instance it depends on the fill color: as long as the object has a fill, user interactions will work as expected. Don't use fill: none , unless you don't want interactions with the inner part of the tool. Use fill: rgba(0,0,0,0) for 'invisible' backgrounds for circles/rectangles that need interaction! Icons are an exception: icons are actually SVG images. Since an icon's background has no fill, it would be difficult to use a three-dot menu icon, for example. You'd have to touch the dots to get every interaction noticed! Therefore, the SAK Icon Tool draws an invisible background behind the icon to respond to tap actions. It uses a rectangle without a line, but with a fill color of fill: rgba(0,0,0,0) . This makes it visually invisible, but still responds to pointer/touch events. Current - per tool - support \u00b6 1.0.0 Each tool has its own user_actions section, independent of the definition of entities . It means that the same entity, but a different tool, can respond differently to a tap action by defining a list of actions : No interaction at all An action to toggle a light An action to get the more-info popup dialog or a custom popup dialog An action to go to another view, ie an URL etc. You can define multiple actions per tap/click action! So you can call multiple Home Assistant backend services with a single click. A tool connected to an entity will automatically declare the 'more-info' action. But ONLY if there is no tap_action defined! If you don't want any interaction, disable this by defining an empty user_actions.tap_action! Some examples \u00b6 If you want the whole card to interact with a click, define a rectangle with the size of the card. And use a fill color of fill: rgba(0,0,0,0) .

HTML does create a so-called bounding box around the objects to facilitate interaction (mouse or touch) with them. SVG doesn't have that functionality yet: it's part of the unreleased SVG 2.0 specification. Interaction with an SVG object depends on things like an object's 'fill', its 'visibility', and whether it has been painted or not.

This applies at least to text-based tools like entity names, areas, and states. For the graphical tools like circles and rectangles for instance it depends on the fill color: as long as the object has a fill, user interactions will work as expected. Don't use fill: none , unless you don't want interactions with the inner part of the tool. Use fill: rgba(0,0,0,0) for 'invisible' backgrounds for circles/rectangles that need interaction! Icons are an exception: icons are actually SVG images. Since an icon's background has no fill, it would be difficult to use a three-dot menu icon, for example. You'd have to touch the dots to get every interaction noticed! Therefore, the SAK Icon Tool draws an invisible background behind the icon to respond to tap actions. It uses a rectangle without a line, but with a fill color of fill: rgba(0,0,0,0) .

SAK templates operate on a different level: they enable the re-use of tools , toolsets , JavaScript templates/snippets , colorstops/lists and more. SAK templates therefore make re-use within a SAK card, and between SAK cards possible! And as you can scale a toolset , you can use different sizes of a toolset template in various cards. Example 7 shows an example of re-using a toolset in various sizes. Basics \u00b6 Usage SAK Templates can cover almost any part of the SAK YAML configuration. Most used templates are: toolsets derived entities colorstops and colorlists A template can use another template Yup. Templates can use templates. A toolset template for instance can use a colorstop template. But take care: don't create a loop. There is no safeguard for this (ab)use. Location SAK templates are stored in the lovelace\\sak_templates\\templates folder and automatically included by the sak_templates.yaml file in the lovelace/sak_templates folder. Examples \u00b6 Toolset example \u00b6 This example shows the use of a Toolset template. it shows the name of the template to use it shows the variables to pass to the template view-xyz.yaml 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 - toolset : memory # template type be of type \"toolset\" # Use pre-defined template for this part. # Template has variables. template : name : tools_segarc_icon_state variables : # Pass the list of variables - entity : 0 # - entity id - cx : 72.5 # - center x position - cy : 74 # - center y position Below the partial config of the tools_segarc_icon_state template: the first 7 lines define the template part with passed variables of the config from line 8, the toolset itself is defined.

You define a colorstops template, and use that in several cards/tools. view 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 - type : 'segarc' position : cx : 50 cy : 50 start_angle : -130 end_angle : 130 width : 7 radius : 45 entity_index : 0 scale : min : 15 # Inside temperature max : 25 offset : -4.5 show : style : colorstops # Use a colorstop segments : colorstops : # The colorstops dict is replaced template : # Use template colorstops (re-use!) name : colorstops_temperature_inside variables : # Pass variables to template - thegap : 1 And the full colorstop template definition: template 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 colorstops_temperature_inside : template : type : colorstops # MUST reference colorstops defaults : # Give vars a default value - thegap : 1 colorstops : # The contents of the template! gap : '[[thegap]]' # Use '[[ ]]' for template vars colors : 17 : 'PowderBlue' 19 : 'var(--theme-gradient-color-01)' 21 : 'var(--theme-gradient-color-04)' The result would be a replaced colorstops part: result 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 - type : 'segarc' position : cx : 50 cy : 50 start_angle : -130 end_angle : 130 width : 7 radius : 45 entity_index : 0 scale : min : 15 # Inside temperature max : 25 offset : -4.5 show : style : colorstops # Use a colorstop segments : colorstops : # The colorstops dict is replaced gap : 1 colors : 17 : 'PowderBlue' 19 : 'var(--theme-gradient-color-01)' 21 : 'var(--theme-gradient-color-04)' Derived Entity example \u00b6 Many examples calculate the brightness attribute from a light using a derived_entity : Home Assistant passes the brightness attribute as a value between 0 and 255. This range is converted using a JavaScript template to a 0..100 (%) range. Example 10 is using a template for one card to show that you could re-use this JavaScript template. view 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 - type : segarc id : 0 entity_index : 1 position : cx : 80 cy : 25 start_angle : 0 end_angle : 360 width : 2 radius : 15 scale : min : 0 max : 100 show : scale : false style : 'colorlist' derived_entity : template : name : derived_entity_brightness # BUG: # Do need a variable section here and defaults in # template itself.

In some cases however, one wants to change more parts of the template in which case variables may not suit those needs. In those cases, SAK templates provide the same sort of functionality as the built-in YAML Overrides and Extensions. Position override example \u00b6 This example shows the simple use of overwriting parts of the Toolset template without using template variables. In this case the position record is simply overridden instead of passing cx and cy as variables. From: view-sake7.yaml 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 - toolset : memory # Use pre-defined template for this part. # Template has variables. template : name : tools_segarc_icon_state variables : # Pass the list of variables - entity : 0 # - entity id position : # 'Overwrite' the position from template cx : 72.5 # Yes, we could have passed these as... cy : 74 # ...variables! Tool override within toolset example \u00b6 We can even go a bit further and overwrite a tool within the list of tools. A tool needs a unique ID to be able to overwrite the tool config In this case the segarc has id: 0 and parts of the config are overwritten! Overriding and extending parts of a template is powerfull but can be error-prone. So take care! The yellow lines show the parts that are overwritten.

That's good! If you're a graphic designer or some UX guy/woman, you will probably have tons of ideas, and after understanding the possibilities, you immediately fire up Adobe Indesign, Affinity Designer, Inkscape, or Procreate on your PC/Mac/iPad or went online using Figma or some other online tool to sketch your design. You're one of those people: The nice thing about the Swiss Army Knife is that you can design your own card. But not everybody is a graphical designer, so how to approach designing a visualization in that case if you're one of the below people? The bad thing about the Swiss Army Knife is that you do need a design for a card. Get inspired! \u00b6 If you browse the internet you can find all sorts of visualizations. I just picked 3 as an example: The left one is a simple flat design with no fancy stuff on it if we forget the waves in the background. The center is based on a Neumorphic design. I used that for some of the examples. You probably recognize the typical discs! By the way, the shadows in this example are a bit exaggerated for my taste. I've used more subtle shadows in the examples. The right one resembles a Homekit-alike design. It's clean and simple. All three are completely different designs, and all three can be build using the Swiss Army Knife card! Of course, you can't build them EXACTLY that way, but you can come a long way mimicking these examples. You will find several designs in the examples About half of them use a Neumorphic design, and the other half flat and Homekit alike designs. Ok, I got inspired. Now what? \u00b6 Well, you can try different approaches. Re-use an existing card and modify this to your own needs to design your own card Re-use some existing design you found on the internet to design your own card Create something completely new and have a unique card design Most of the possible card visualizations have been created I think. So taking inspiration from something you found on the web and using that as the basis for your cards is a tried and true approach. Once you've decided what style you want, you can start designing your cards. You can choose the simple approach or a more professional approach: The simple approach of \"outlining something\" and then trying to make it using trial and error in YAML Create a real design in an app on a 100x100 artboard and then create the card using the dimensions and coordinates of the design The easy approach: hand sketching some design \u00b6 I used this a lot and created about 50 of these sketches in Procreate on my iPad. Only some of them made it in production. Many were not useful, too complex to make, or just ugly. Below you see one of those sketches. It shows a pre-version of the server example (See: example 7 ) and a production example of the lights (See: example 2 ). Not yet Leonardo da Vinci quality, but I'm learning. At least my handwriting is on par with a doctor I then use this sketch as the basis to create the card. It took some guessing about coordinates and sizes. I use Notepad++ as an editor to produce the YAML. After every \"save\" action, I hit F5 to refresh Home Assistant's view to check if I'm satisfied with the result. If not, rinse and repeat... The server card took a lot of trial-and-error to get the 4 CPU/Load circles aligned the way I wanted to: The lights were much easier, as it involved much less parts: The professional approach: using an app \u00b6 Below you see Affinity Designer in action. For example 6 , I wanted to create something different with circles as the background, and on top of that some SAK tools (circles) with weather and airvisual data. The design is for a square card, so I created an artboard with a size 100mmx100mm. This is the default 'coordinate' system for a square card. As a result, the coordinates shown by Affinity Designer can be copied 1:1 in the cards YAML definition. No trial-and-error this time placing the tools at the right location. The units used are NOT relevant, it's all about a 100x100 canvas. Use centons if you like... As an example, I selected one of the circles where the weather type will be put. In the lower right corner of the Affinity Designer screen, you can see that I selected the center coordinates and (if you look closely) that the X coordinate is 77 (mm) and the Y coordinate 59 (mm). You also notice the width/height for the circle is 22 (mm). The resulting partial YAML definition is as follows: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 - toolset : weather-type position : # The center X and Y position from Affinity Designer cx : 77 cy : 59 tools : # The height is 22. We make the circle a bit smaller: # Outer is 22. Radius = 22/2 - 4 = 7 - type : 'circle' id : 0 position : cx : 50 cy : 50 radius : 7 styles : circle : fill : white And the final result after placing all the SAK tools ( circles , entity icon , entity state , and weather type ) on top of the background : a nice visualization, a bit artistic, clean, and showing a fair bit of information. The gradient also gives a nice touch to the overall look & feel. A word on Theme usage \u00b6 If you want your design to work in both Light and Dark theme mode, make sure you use theme colors for the implementation of your design. Swiss Army Knife examples 11 and 12 use my Home Assistant Material 3 themes to implement cards that adapt to theme colors and to theme modes (dark/light).

The first lights row shows some cards with different experimental sliders and a segmented arc to display the brightness. The other rows show a standard light card. The light switch (all cards) The light switch is made out of 3 circles and an icon: the 1 st (bottom) circle is used to get the Neumorphic effect: a button that 'rises' out of the background. It also servers as the edge of the light button. the second circle is used to display the activation ring; orange if 'on' and light grey if 'off'. the third (top) circle is used to display the inset shadow effect as if the button is \"pressed\". last but not least: the light icon is displayed on top of all those circles. First card The first card shows a \"more-info\" button in the top left, the ligh button, the name of the light, and a slider with the actual percentage on the right side of the slider. The position of that value can be defined in the card. Second and third card The configurable position of the percentage is visible in the second and third card: apart from using a different styled slider, the percentage is shown in the circle where the segmented arc is also defined.

That should also cover Android devices using Chromium-based browsers which I could not test as I don't have any Android devices. A quick view on a friend's Samsung showed no problems, but that is no 100% guarantee of course. Due to the browser differences and long-standing bugs in Safari, some parts of SAK have different rendering paths for Safari and Chromium. One notable difference between the two is the SVG filter implementation of Safari. It works but takes a small performance hit compared to Chromium, which has a better and faster filter implementation. Safari users will therefore see a difference between a switch to a view with filters (like a Neumorphic design) and a Flat design: the latter is faster with the initial loading of the view.

Introduction \u00b6 I am a longtime Home Assistant user. At the time, YAML was about the only way to configure Home Assistant. About every two weeks, you were confronted with the famous list of \"breaking changes\" that led you to change your configuration and explain to the wife that it was okay for the lights to come on during the day and not at night: it only takes me a few hours to fix it. No worries I am visually oriented. And with the introduction of Lovelace and the creation of countless custom cards, many choices were made available to visualize the sensor data. And thanks to the vibrant community, there was a built-in or custom-card for about everything you wanted. Happy, but I want more! \u00b6 Despite all those choices, I adapted these cards in many cases to get the visualization I wanted. And by doing that I learned step-by-step the inner workings of a custom card and the basis for these cards: the web-component Lit. During the adaption of another custom card, the question \"What if I would have the possibility to design my own visualization?\" came up more and more. In that case, I could design completely different cards than currently available. But: I'm not a real programmer, I learn by looking at how other people solve problems, and by understanding that, I can create my own code to solve my own problems. So, how feasible is it to create my own card? And then shit happened... \u00b6 The kind of shit that can't be fixed easily: my little sister got diagnosed with cancer. The first MRI scans were good though: 100% chance of survival and she got her operation. But then things turned for the worse: metastatic cancer. She died 6 months later in 2021, almost in full isolation due to the covid pandemic. At the time of that fatal message, I needed something positive to balance all the negative things and decided to take the challenge and start building my own card: The versatile multi-tool custom card aka the Swiss Army Knife custom card was born! The dilemma: release or not? \u00b6 I stopped working on this custom card after my sister died: I had other things to do, and its purpose had suddenly \"disappeared\" somehow. In November 2021 I asked myself \"What to do now?\". The card is unfinished, no one but me has used it, has no documentation, and given its size, that could be quite a big undertaking. In addition, users will find bugs that need fixing. And I have to do other things too. But what if I get help? I posted a teaser of the card on the Dutch Tweakers forum : and one of them suggested a closed beta. And so it was! About 40 Home Assistant users wanted to become beta testers. That is doable for me! It got me to start creating the documentation you are reading right now! Back in 2021, I had the idea to release the custom card (as RC or BETA) around March/April 2022, but handling my sister's estate appeared to be more complex than I anticipated, so the public RC release was delayed until the end of June 2022. Nearly 2 years after I started building this card! I used Material for MkDocs to create this documentation: a great piece of software with a good navigation system, even better formatting solutions, and on top of that customization to better suit my needs. The documentation uses the \"Learn by Example\" paradigm It's a method I really like. Instead of long, very long tables of information, concrete examples are shown that are easy to understand and use in practice. The examples also show the context and relationship between options, something most tables don't have or are difficult to describe. The examples are real examples used in my own Home Assistant environment. They use (of course) my entity declarations, which you have to replace with your own sensors to make the visualization work. It is because of that reason I use the AirVisual and Met.no weather integration a lot: these ones are very easy to adapt to your own installation. Some statistics \u00b6 Last but not least: some statistics. As of December 2021 about 1.000 hours of work are put into this card. That is with a 40 hour week about 6 months of work! The size of the card itself, including comments is about 8.000 lines of JavaScript. I hope, somewhere in the future, I can convert this to TypeScript. I made about 50 sketches and designs in ProCreate on my iPad for visualizations. Just to try out functionality, or to create new functionality. In total, the created Lovelace Views, SAK templates and Decluttering templates cover about 11.000 lines of YAML. File sizes vary between 170 lines for a view with perfect re-use, templates, etc. up to so-called copy/paste views containing many cards and resulting in a size of 3.500 lines of YAML. About 12 example views are created to be used as an example or inspiration for other users than me.

As the math is from the center, we take 7/2 = 3.5 as the value to do the math with the scale offset is -4.5 . That is the offset from the center of the arc bar. A value of -4.5 means on the inside. As the width of the arc is 3.5 from the center, there is a 'gap' between the arc and the scale of 1 . If you want the scale to be on the outside of the arc bar, use a positive offset value. Animation duration \u00b6 The arc uses a custom animation to draw the arc. The animation duration is default 5 seconds and can be configured as follows: 1 2 3 - type : 'segarc' # tooltype is 'segarc' animation : duration : 5 # Animation in seconds Gap between segments \u00b6 The colorlist or colorstop show.style determines the number of segments the arc has.
