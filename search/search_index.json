Basics \u00b6 Card aspect ratio and size \u00b6 The aspectratio configuration determines both the aspect ratio and the size of the SAK Card. The aspect ratio is defined in the card. Below you see the definition of a square card with default size of 100x100. aspectratio : 1/1 # Square card with a 100x100 grid size Example cards with different aspect ratio's \u00b6 Some examples for aspect ratio's of: 0.5/1 , 1/1 , 2/1 and 3/1 : Some more examples for aspect ratio's of: 0.5/2 , 1/2 , 2/2 and 3/2 : You are not limited to these aspect ratio's. Any aspect ratio will work But what about the size then? \u00b6 If I would place three square cards in a horizontal-stack with different aspect ratio's, I get three equally sized cards. All cards scale to the same actual size in pixels, independently of their internal canvas sizes of 100x100, 200x200 and 400x400. 1/1 2/2 4/4 The result of these different internal sizes can be seen in the following example: I \"designed\" a toolset with a single circle on a standard 100x100 canvas and placed the toolset for each card on the same position (50,50); The circle scales to the actual canvas dimensions of the card. Scalable Vector Graphics at work! 1/1 2/2 4/4 Toolset and tool placement \u00b6 Let's start with the most important specifications The position and dimensions of a tool always reference a default toolset grid size of 100x100 Where: (0,0) is the upper left corner of the grid (100,100) is the lower right corner of the grid Furthermore, all dimensions are relative to the grid: a line with a length of 10 takes 10% of the grid. a circle with radius of 50 fits exactly the grid. Therefore, the center position of a toolset is always (50,50) This center position is the 'anchor' used by the Toolset to position the tools on a card. However, the size and position are not limited by this grid size! So: a tool can be wider and higher can be placed outside these default coordinates: so coordinates can be < 0 or > 100. Don't forget that toolsets can scale tools and are re-usable if defined as a template An example \u00b6 Now that we know all that, how does this actually work in practice? Let's look at the example with a card size of 200x100 and two toolsets consisting of a circle , icon and state . In a kind of 3D world, it looks like this: The tools are neatly configured around the center position (50,50) of the toolsetgrid: they have no knowledige of the size of the card, nor the placement on the card. That is the task of the toolset! The YAML definition is shown below. Here you see the toolsets (named set1 and set2) and the different tools: circle , state and icon . For brevity only the coordinates/sizes part is shown. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 aspectratio : 2/1 # Gives a 200x100 canvas size layout : # Circles with icon and state are placed at (40,50) and (160,50) toolsets : - toolset : set1 position : cx : 40 cy : 50 tools : - type : circle position : cx : 50 # Circle is centered on 100x100 cy : 50 radius : 25 - type : state position : cx : 50 # x centered cy : 60 # y a bit lower - type : icon position : cx : 50 # x centered cy : 40 # y a bit higher align : center icon_size : 15 - toolset : set2 position : cx : 160 cy : 50 tools : - type : circle position : cx : 50 # Circle is centered on 100x100 cy : 50 radius : 25 - type : state position : cx : 50 # x centered cy : 60 # y a bit lower - type : icon position : cx : 50 # x centered cy : 40 # y a bit higher align : center icon_size : 15 Use relative sizes for styles too, where possible \u00b6 One easy example is the CSS font-size attribute: use em and not px to configure the size of a font, ie use font-size: 12em . SAK has configured the default font-size for SAK cards to be about the same as the 1% of the grid: so font-size: 10em should be about 10% of the grid in size.","title":"Coordinate system"},{"location":"basics/coordinate-system/#basics","text":"","title":"\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n Basics"},{"location":"basics/coordinate-system/#card-aspect-ratio-and-size","text":"The aspectratio configuration determines both the aspect ratio and the size of the SAK Card.

The first lights row shows some cards with different experimental sliders and a segmented arc to display the brightness. The other rows show a standard light card. The light switch (all cards) The light switch is made out of 3 circles and an icon: the 1 st (bottom) circle is used to get the Neumorphic effect: a button that 'rises' out of the background. It also servers as the edge of the light button. the second circle is used to display the activation ring; orange if 'on' and light grey if 'off'. the third (top) circle is used to display the inset shadow effect as if the button is \"pressed\". last but not least: the light icon is displayed on top of all those circles. First card The first card shows a \"more-info\" button in the top left, the ligh button, the name of the light, and a slider with the actual percentage on the right side of the slider. The position of that value can be defined in the card. Second and third card The configurable position of the percentage is visible in the second and third card: apart from using a different styled slider, the percentage is shown in the circle where the segmented arc is also defined.

Clicking the light icon toggles the state of the light Clicking on the slider will set the brightness to the percentage. Dragging the slider will set the brightness and update the lights brightness semi-realtime 4 times a second. Menu in upper left corner can be difficult to touch/click The SVG Icon has no real \"touch/click\" area attached (yet). Therefore it is difficult to activate the menu as SVG Icons can only be touched/clicked on the foreground part of the icon. The slider has a touch/click area attached, so is perfectly to use Except for a little bug where the thumb is pulled to the edge of the touch/click area or the brightness is set to 100%, and cannot be controlled anymore. In this case clicking/touching the slider makes the thumb accessible again. The thumb of the slider of the first card is not positioned correctly The slider expects to be in the center of the card, which this slider is not.

If you're a graphic designer or some UX guy/woman, you will probably have tons of idea's, and after understanding the possibilities, you immediately fire up Adobe Indesign, Affinity Designer, Inkscape or Procreate on your PC/Mac/iPad or went online on Figma or some other online tool to sketch your design. You're one of those people: The nice thing about the Swiss Army Knife is that you can design your own card. But not everybody is a graphical designer, so how to approach designing a visualization in that case if you're one of the below people? The bad thing about the Swiss Army Knife is that you do need a design for a card. Get inspired! \u00b6 If you browse the internet you can find all sorts of visualizations. I just picked 3 as an example: The left one is a very simple and flat design without any fancy things on it if we forget the waves on the background. The middle is a based on a Neumorphic design. A Design that I used for most of my examples. You'll probably recognize the typical discs! The shadows in this example are a bit exaggerated for my taste btw. I have used more subtle shadows in the examples. The right one resembles a Homekit alike design. It is clean and simple. All three are completely different designs, and all three can be build using the Swiss Army Knife card! Of course, you can't build them EXACTLY that way, but you can come a long way mimicking these examples. You will find several designs in the examples Most of them are (currently) using a Neumorphic design, but other flat and Homekit alike designs are also there. Ok, I got inspired. Now what? \u00b6 Well, you can try different approaches. Re-use an existing card and modify this to your own needs to design your own card Re-use some existing design you found on the internet to design your own card Create something completely new and have a unique card design Most of the possible card visualizations have been created I think, so being inspired by something that you found on the internet and use that as the basis for your own cards is a well proven approach. Once you have decided what kind of style you want, you can start designing your cards. You can choose the simple approach or a more professional approach: The simple approach by \"Sketching something\" and then try to create this using trial-and-error in YAML Make a real design in an app on a 100x100 artboard, and then make the card using the design's measurements and coordinates The easy approach: hand sketching some design \u00b6 I used this a lot and created about 50 of these sketches in Procreate on my iPad. Only some of them made it in production. Many of them where not useful, too complex to make or just ugly. Below you see one of those sketches. It shows a pre-version of the server example (See: example 7 ) and a real production example of the lights (See: example 2 ). Not yet Leonardo da Vinci quality, but I'm learning. At least my handwriting is on par with a doctor I then use this sketch as the basis to create the card. This took some guessing about coordinates and sizes. I use Notepad++ as editor to produce the YAML and after every \"save\" action, I hit F5 to refresh HA's view to check if I'm satisfied with the result. If not, rinse and repeat... The server card took a lot of trial-and-error to get the 4 CPU/Load circles aligned the way I wanted to: The lights where much easier, as it involved much less parts: The professional approach: using an app \u00b6 Below you see Affinity Designer in action. For example 6 , I wanted to create something different with circles as the background, and on top of that some SAK tools (circles) with weather and airvisual data. The design is for a square card, so Icreated an artboard with size 100mmx100mm. This is the default 'coordinate' system for a square card. As a result the coordinates shown by Affinity Designer can be copied 1:1 in the cards YAML definition. No trial-and-error this time placing the tools at the right location. The units used are NOT relevant, it's all about a 100x100 canvas. Use centons if you like... As an example I selected one of the circles where the weather type will be put. In the lower right corner of the Affinity Designer screen, you can see that I selected the center coordinates and (if you look closely) that the X coordinate is 77 (mm) and the Y coordinate 59 (mm). You also notice the width/height for the circle is 22 (mm). The resulting partial YAML definition is as follows: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 - toolset : weather-type position : # The center X and Y position from Affinity Designer cx : 77 cy : 59 tools : # The height is 22. We make the circle a bit smaller: # Outer is 22. Radius = 22/2 - 4 = 7 - type : 'circle' id : 0 position : cx : 50 cy : 50 radius : 7 styles : circle : fill : white And the final result after placing all the SAK tools on top of the background: a nice visualization, a bit artistic, clean and showing a fair bit of information. The gradient also gives a nice touch to the overall look & feel.","title":"Designing your card"},{"location":"start/designing-your-card/#where-to-start","text":"So, you came here to read how to design your own card.

In those days YAML was about the only way to configure Home Assistant, and every two weeks you were confronted with the famous list of \"breaking changes\" which led to changing your configuration and explaining the wife that it was ok that lights went on during daytime and not in the evening: I just needed a few hours to fix it. No worries I'm visually oriented. And with the introduction of Lovelace and the numerous custom cards as a result, many choices to visualize the sensor data were created: for about everything you wanted, there was a built-in card or custom card thanks to the vibrant community. Happy, but I want more! \u00b6 Despite all those choices, I adapted these cards in many cases to get the visualization I wanted. And by doing that I learned step-by-step the inner workings of a custom card and the basis for these cards: the web-component Lit. During the adaption of another custom card, the question \"What if I would have the possibility to design my own visualization?\" came up more and more. In that case I could design completely different cards than currently available. But: I'm not a real programmer, I learn by looking how other people solve problems, and by understanding that, I can create my own code to solve my own problems, so how feasible is it to create my own card? And then shit happened... \u00b6 The kind of shit that can't be fixed easily: my little sister got diagnosed with cancer. The first MRI scans where good though: 100% chance of survival and she got her operation. But then things turned for the worse: metastatic cancer. She died 6 months later in 2021, almost in full isolation due to the covid pandemic. At the time of that fatal message I needed something positive to balance all the negative things and decided to take the challenge and start building my own card: The Swiss Army Knife with all its tools was born! The dilemma: release or not? \u00b6 I stopped working on this card after my sister died: I had other things to do, and its purpose was suddenly \"gone\" somehow. In November 2021 I asked myself \"What to do now?\". The card is not finished, no one but me has used it, has no documentation and given the size that might be a pretty big undertaking. Furthermore bugs will be found and need to be fixed. And I need to do other things too... But what if I got help? I placed a teaser of the card on the Dutch Tweakers forum: And one of them proposed a closed beta. And so it was! About 10 Home Assistant users wanted to become beta testers. That is doable for me! This made me start producing the documentation you're reading now! The documentation is made with Material for MkDocs: a great piece of software that has a great navigation system, even greater formatting solutions and on top of that customization to better suit my needs. The documentation uses the \"Learn by Example\" paradigm Its a method I really like. Instead of long, very long tables with information, actual examples are shown which are easy to understand and use in practice. The examples also show the context and relation between options, something that most tables don't, or have trouble describing. The examples are real examples used in my own Home Assistant environment. They use of course my entity declarations, which you have to change to use your own sensors to make the visualization work. It is because of that reason I use the Met.no weather integration a lot: this one is very easy to adapt to your own installation. Some statistics \u00b6 Last but not least: some statistics. As of December 2021 about 1.000 hours of work are put into this card. That is with a 40 hour week about 6 months of work! The size of the card itself, including comments is about 8.000 lines of JavaScript. I hope, somewhere in the future, I can convert this to TypeScript. I made about 50 sketches and designs for visualizations. Just to try out functionality, or to create new functionality. In total, the created Lovelace Views, SAK templates and Decluttering templates cover about 11.000 lines of YAML. File sizes vary between 170 lines for a view with perfect re-use, templates, etc. up to so-called copy/paste views containing many cards and resulting in a size of 3.500 lines of YAML. About 10 example views are created to be used as an example or inspiration for other users than me. These examples are included in the documentation (See Examples ) and in GitHub.
